SpatialSwap is a Winforms desktop application that swaps between versions of Oracle.  Originally created specifically for Oracle spatial database, it could be used without much adjustment to manage multiple versions of any application set in which it is necessary to have multiple versions maintained on a single PC.  Administration is done using an XML file which may be edited directly to customize the application to suit needs.
